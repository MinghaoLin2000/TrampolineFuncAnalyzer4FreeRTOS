# CodeqlForFreertos
An automatic tool to identify all trampoline functions in FreeRTOS that can cause arbitrary read/write and DoS because of lacking checks.

## Usage
1. install and configure CodeQL
2. import `rtosdatabase3` directory to VS Code. rtosdatabse3 is source code data generated by CodeQL for FreeRTOS
3. run the script `CodeqlForFreertos/vscode-codeql-starter/codeql-custom-queries-cpp/example.ql`

## Note
- The rtosdatabase3 included all MPU_ functions. We have added some functions that were not enabled by macro definitions into the database by modifying the code, ensuring that every function can be scanned.
- We recommend operating the script in VSCode for a more convenient experience.
- There are three scanning modes available. You can choose which one to run, but manual further auditing is still required.
